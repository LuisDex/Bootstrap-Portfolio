                            <p>First and foremost: Thank you for taking a moment to visit my portfolio. My name is Luis
                                R. Perez but I go by Dexter, from the 90's cartoon Dexter's Laboratory. My background
                                is a mixed one as I have both extensive knowledge in writing, editing and proofreading,
                                and technological know how that is spread through many different facets of the computer
                                world. </p>
                            <p>This past year I took the first steps towards a new career by signing up for the UCF
                                Coding Bootcamp with the hopes that my past knowledge of programming had not rusted too
                                badly. Thankfully, after tackling the different challenges placed before me by my
                                Instructional Team, I can safely say that my programming skills have benefited greatly
                                from my writing, editing and proofing skills that I have polished throughout the years.</p>
                            <p>In my Portfolio page you will find a few examples of the different projects that I
                                completed throughout my time in the Coding Bootcamp. These examples showcase the
                                different skills, and programming languages that are essential for any Developer in
                                today's market. </p>
